# Pencil Sketch Converter

Welcome to the Pencil Sketch Converter repository! This project aims to provide a simple yet effective Python script to convert images into pencil sketches. We utilize popular libraries such as OpenCV and SciPy Image to achieve this.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hamad_marral/Pencil_sketch.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy scipy
   ```

3. **Run the Script**: Navigate to the cloned directory and run the `pencil_sketch.py` script:

   ```bash
   cd Pencil_sketch
   python pencil_sketch.py
   ```

4. **Input Image**: The script will prompt you to enter the path to the image you want to convert.

5. **Output**: After processing, the script will generate two images:
   - A grayscale version of the input image.
   - A pencil sketch version of the input image.

6. **Enjoy Your Sketch**: Find the generated images in the same directory as the script.

## Libraries Used

- **OpenCV**: Open Source Computer Vision Library for image processing tasks.
- **NumPy**: Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, used for array manipulation.
- **SciPy Image**: A collection of algorithms for image processing.
